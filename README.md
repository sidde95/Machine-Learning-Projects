# Machine Learning Projects

Welcome to my **Machine Learning Projects** repository!  
This repository contains **end-to-end ML projects**, including **data preprocessing, model building, hyperparameter tuning, evaluation, and deployment**. All projects are implemented in **Python** using popular libraries like `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, `numpy`, and deployed with **Streamlit** for interactive applications.
